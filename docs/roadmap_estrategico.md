### **The 2030 Vision Statement**

> *"By 2030, when a entrepreneur in São Paulo, Mexico City, or Bogotá thinks about starting a business, the first question won't be 'How do I handle invoicing?' - it will be 'How fast can I integrate with [Our Platform]?' We will have made modern financial infrastructure so accessible, so powerful, and so indispensable that not using it puts businesses at a fundamental disadvantage. We will be the AWS of business finance for Latin America."*

**🚀 From Ecuadorian startup to Latin American infrastructure. From invoice processing to business empowerment. From competitor to category creator.**

**The roadmap is clear. The opportunity is massive. The time is now.**
